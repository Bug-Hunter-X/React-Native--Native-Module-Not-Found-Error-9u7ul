To solve this, ensure that all native dependencies are correctly installed and linked.  For example, if you're using React Native 0.60 and above, you should use the autolinking feature.  However, older versions or more complex libraries might need manual linking.

**Steps to fix (Android):**
1. **Verify installation:** Ensure you have correctly installed the native module using the library's instructions. This often involves running commands such as `npm install` or `yarn add`.
2. **Check Android/app/build.gradle:**  Confirm that the native module's dependencies are listed under the `dependencies` block.
3. **Clean and rebuild:** Clean and rebuild the project.  In Android Studio, you can do this via `Build` -> `Clean Project` and then `Build` -> `Rebuild Project`.
4. **Manual linking (if necessary):** If autolinking fails, refer to the library's documentation for manual linking instructions. This often involves steps within the Android project directory.

**Steps to fix (iOS):**
1. **Verify installation:** Similar to Android, ensure the native module is correctly installed.
2. **Check Podfile:** Verify that the necessary pods are listed in your `ios/Podfile`. This file manages the iOS dependencies.
3. **Run pod install:** Execute `pod install` from within the `ios` directory.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Clean and rebuild the Xcode project.
5. **Manual linking (if necessary):** Consult the library's documentation for manual linking guidance if the automatic process fails.
