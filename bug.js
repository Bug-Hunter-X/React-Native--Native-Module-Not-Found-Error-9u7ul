This error occurs when using a library that requires specific native modules, but those modules are not correctly linked or installed in your React Native project.  It often manifests during runtime, and the exact error message might vary depending on the library and the missing module.  A common scenario is using a third-party library that uses native code, but the native components are not installed or linked properly. For example, using a library that depends on a module that's not available for your target platform (iOS or Android).
